% I tried extensively to get this test to *fail* again prior to v0.14.15
% release but failed. Even reverting the "fixing" commit 9d6691f and a whole
% bunch of subsequent stuff I couldn't make it fail again. Apparently not only
% the initial fix but also other subsequent algorythm and processing order
% changes have added safety rails. It's possible even newer ICU libraries are
% involved in the layers of fixes. Hence I'm simplying the test on the
% assumption that the having apostrophe locations before, at, and after
% a disired break point *would* trigger this bug if we ever were to resurface
% it but that isn't confirmed. If in doubt revert this test to v0.14.14.
