\chapter{Some Useful SILE Commands}

We’re going to organise our tour of SILE by usage:
    we’ll start by giving you the most useful commands that you’ll need to get started typesetting documents using SILE, and then we’ll gradually move into more and more obscure corners as the documentation progresses.

\section{Fonts}

The most basic command for altering the look of the text is the \autodoc:command{\font} command.
It takes two forms:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\code{\\font[\em{parameters…}]\{\em{argument}\}}}
\item{\code{\\font[\em{parameters…}]}}
\end{itemize}

The first form sets the given argument text in the specified font;
    the second form changes the font used to typeset text from this point on.

For instance:

\begin[type=autodoc:codeblock]{raw}
Small text

\font[size=15pt]%
Big text!

\font[size=30pt]{Bigger text}

Still big text!
\end{raw}

\noindent{}produces:

\begin{autodoc:example}%
Small text

\font[size=15pt]%
Big text!

\font[size=30pt]{Bigger text}

{}Still big text!
\end{autodoc:example}

\par

\font[size=11pt]%

As you can see, one possible attribute is \code{size}, which can be specified as a SILE \code{<dimension>}.
A \code{<dimension>} is like a \code{<basic length>} (described above) but with a few extra possible dimensions.
There are dimensions which are relative to the size of the \em{current} font: an \code{em} is the size of the font’s current em square (for a 12pt font, this would be 12 points);
    an \code{en} is half the em square;
    an \code{ex} is the height of the character ‘x’;
    a \code{spc} is the width of the space character.

There are also dimensions which are defined as a percentage of the size of the current page width or height, the current frame width or height, and the line width (\code{\%pw}, \code{\%ph}, \code{\%fw}, \code{\%fh}, and \code{\%lw}, respectively).
You can specify lengths in terms of the current paragraph skip (\code{ps}) and baseline skip (\code{bs}), which will make sense later on.
Additional units are available relative to the largest or smallest value of either axis (\code{\%pmax}, \code{\%pmin}, \code{\%fmax}, \code{\%fmin}).

The full list of attributes to the \autodoc:command{\font} command are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{size}: As above.}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{family}: The name of the font to be selected.
    SILE should know about all the fonts installed on your system, so that fonts can be specified by their name.}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{filename}: If a filename is supplied, SILE will use the font file provided rather than looking at your system’s font library.}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{style}: Can be \code{normal} or \code{italic}.}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{weight}: A CSS-style numeric weight ranging from \font[weight=100]{100}, through \font[weight=200]{200}, \font[weight=300]{300}, \font[weight=400]{400}, \font[weight=500]{500}, \font[weight=600]{600}, \font[weight=700]{700}, \font[weight=800]{800} to \font[weight=900]{900}.
    Not all fonts will support all weights (many just have two), but SILE will choose the closest.}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{features}: Enable or disable OpenType feature flags (\code{-hlig}, \code{+ss01})}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{variant}: A font variant (\code{normal}, \code{smallcaps})}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{variations}: Set OpenType variations axis values used in variable fonts (e.g. \code{variations="wdth=122"}).%
\footnote{Support for variations requires at least HarfBuzz 6.
    If SILE is built on a system without support, an error will be thrown when trying to render documents using variations.}}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{language}: The two letter (ISO639-1) language code for the text.
    This will affect both font shaping and hyphenation.}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{direction}: The expected text direction.
    (\code{LTR-TTB} for left to right, top to bottom; \code{RTL-BTT} would set text right to left, bottom to top!)}
\item{\autodoc:parameter{script}: The script family in use.
    (See Chapter 7, “Language,” for more on these past three settings.)}
\end{itemize}

It’s quite fiddly to be always changing font specifications manually;
    later we’ll see some ways to automate the process.
SILE’s \autodoc:class{plain} class notably provides the \autodoc:command{\strong{…}} command as a a shortcut for \autodoc:command{\font[weight=700]{…}}, and the \autodoc:command{\em{…}} to emphasize text (switching between italic or regular style as needed).

Note for parameters that accept multiple values, values may be separated with commas.
Be sure to wrap the value in quotes so the commas don’t get parsed as new parameters.
For example \autodoc:command{\font[features="+calt,+ss01"]} will enable OpenType feature flags for both contextual alternatives and alternative style set 1.
Similarly values that are themselves key=value pairs the quotation marks will keep them separate from other parameters.
For example \autodoc:command{\font[variations="wght=150,wdth=122"]} can be used to set both the weight and width axis values.

\section{Document structure}

SILE provides a number of different \em{class}es of document (similar to LaTeX classes).
By default, you get the \autodoc:class{plain} class, which has very little support for structured documents.
There is also the \autodoc:class{book} class, which adds support for right and left page masters, running headers, footnotes, and chapter, section and subsection headings.

To use the commands in this section, you will need to request the \autodoc:class{book} class by specifying, in your \code{\\begin\{document\}} command, the \autodoc:parameter{class=book} parameter;
    for example, the document you are currently reading begins with the command \code{\\begin[class=book]\{document\}}.

\subsection{Chapters and sections}

If you choose the \autodoc:class{book} class, you can divide your document into different sections using the commands \autodoc:command{\chapter{…}}, \autodoc:command{\section{…}}, and \autodoc:command{\subsection{…}}.
The argument to each command is the name of the chapter or section, respectively.
Chapters will be opened on a new right-hand page, and the chapter name will form the left running header.
Additionally, the section name and number will form the right running header.

\begin{autodoc:note}
Chapters, sections and subsections will be automatically numbered starting from 1.
To alter the numbering, see the documentation for the \autodoc:package{counters} package in the next chapter.
To produce an unnumbered chapter, provide the parameter \autodoc:parameter{numbering=false}.
\end{autodoc:note}

This subsection begins with the command \autodoc:command{\subsection{Chapters and Sections}}.

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes can be added to a book with the \autodoc:command{\footnote{…}} command.%
\footnote{Like this: \autodoc:command{\footnote{Like this.}}}
The argument to the command will be set as a footnote at the bottom of the page.
Footnotes are automatically numbered from 1 at the start of each chapter.

\section{Paragraph indentation}

Paragraphs in SILE normally begin with an indentation (by default, 20 points in width).
To turn this off, you can use the \autodoc:command{\noindent} command at the start of a paragraph.
(This current paragraph doesn’t need to call \autodoc:command{\noindent} because \autodoc:command{\section} and \autodoc:command{\chapter} automatically call it for the text following the heading.)
A \autodoc:command{\noindent} can be cancelled by following it with an \autodoc:command{\indent}.
You can completely turn off indentation for the whole of the document by changing its size to zero.
We’ll see how to change the size of the indentation in the settings chapter, but the easiest way to set it to zero for the whole of the document (rather than for just one paragraph) is to issue the command \autodoc:command{\neverindent}.

\section{Horizontal spacing}

There are also commands to increase the horizontal space in a line;
    from the smallest to the largest, \autodoc:command{\thinspace} (1/6th of an em), \autodoc:command{\enspace} (1 en), \autodoc:command{\quad} (1 em), and \autodoc:command{\qquad} (2em).

If you want to add a very long stretchy space, you can use the command \autodoc:command{\hfill}.
Doing this in conjunction with a line break will cause the line before the break to be flush left, like this.\cr{}The command \autodoc:command{\cr} is a shortcut for \autodoc:command{\hfill\break}.

\section{Vertical spacing}

To increase the vertical space between paragraphs or other elements, the commands \autodoc:command{\smallskip}, \autodoc:command{\medskip} and \autodoc:command{\bigskip} are available to add a 3pt, 6pt, and 12pt gap, respectively.
There will be a \autodoc:command{\bigskip} after this paragraph.

\bigskip%
Besides this predefined skips, you can also use \autodoc:command{\skip[height=<dimension>]} to add a vertical space of a given height.

If you want to add a very long stretchy vertical space, you can use the command \autodoc:command{\vfill}.

When playing with vertical spaces, there is however a few additional considerations to take into account.
Without entering into the details, they are usually ignored at the beginning of a frame.
Would you want to enforce them there, you therefore need to have some initial content.
An empty \autodoc:command{\hbox} can do the trick.
Additionally, there are cases where SILE automaticall inserts a \autodoc:command{\vfill} command at the end of a frame, so you may need to ensure you terminated a paragraph and introduced your own frame break in order to avoid it.
The following example illustrates both techniques.

\begin[type=autodoc:codeblock]{raw}
\hbox{}% This is an empty initial line
\skip[height=2cm]
A paragraph around 2 centimeters below the top of the frame.
\vfill
A paragraph pushed at the bottom of the frame.\par
\break
\end{raw}

\section{Text alignment}

\begin{raggedright}
SILE normally fully-justifies text—that is, it tries to alter the spacing between words so that the text stretches across the full width of the column.%
\footnote{This does not mean that text will always exactly fill the width of the column.
    SILE will choose line breaks and alter the spacing between words up to a certain extent, but when it has done its best, it will typeset the least bad solution;
    this may involve some of the words jutting slightly out into the margin.}
An alternative to full justification is ragged right margin formatting, where the spacing between words is constant but the right hand side of the paragraph may not line up.
Ragged right is often used for children’s books and for frames with narrow columns such as newspapers.
To use ragged right formatting, enclose your text in a \autodoc:environment{raggedright} environment.
This paragraph is set ragged right.
\end{raggedright}

\begin{raggedleft}
Similarly, there is a \autodoc:environment{raggedleft} environment, in which the right-hand margin of the paragraph is fixed, but the left-hand margin is allowed to vary.
This paragraph is set ragged left.\par
\end{raggedleft}

\begin{center}
You can center a paragraph of text by wrapping it in the \autodoc:environment{center} environment.
This paragraph is centered on the page.
\end{center}

\section{Line and page breaks}

SILE automatically determines line and page breaks.
In later chapters we will introduce some \em{settings} which can be used to tweak this process.
However, SILE’s \autodoc:class{plain} class also provides some commands to help the process on its way.

The following four commands can be used to control line breaks (when used \em{within} a paragraph), as well as page breaks (when used \em{between} paragraphs):%
\footnote{The names are similar to those used in (La)TeX, but their semantics differ slightly.}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\autodoc:command{\break}}
\item{\autodoc:command{\goodbreak}}
\item{\autodoc:command{\nobreak}}
\item{\autodoc:command{\allowbreak}}
\end{itemize}

Within a paragraph, the \autodoc:command{\break} command requests a \em{line} break at the given location.%
\footnote{Note that \autodoc:command{\break} just causes a line break, but might not be what you intended, for instance in a justified paragraph.
    As previously noted, the \autodoc:command{\cr} command might do what you actually expected there.}
A less forceful variant is \autodoc:command{\goodbreak}, which suggests to SILE that this is a good point to break a line.
The opposite is \autodoc:command{\nobreak}, which requests that, if at all possible, SILE not break a line at the given point.
A neutral variant is \autodoc:command{\allowbreak}, which allows SILE to break at a point that it would otherwise not consider as suitable for line breaking.

Between paragraphs, these commands have a different meaning.
The \autodoc:command{\break} command requests a \em{frame break} at the given location.
Where there are multiple frames on a page—for instance, in a document with multiple columns—the current frame will be ended and typesetting will recommence at the top of the next frame.
\em{Mutatis mutandis}, \autodoc:command{\goodbreak}, \autodoc:command{\nobreak} and \autodoc:command{\allowbreak} affect frame breaking in a similar way.

The following commands are intended to be used between paragraphs and apply to page breaks only:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\autodoc:command{\novbreak} inhibits a frame break, and is just a convenience over \autodoc:command{\nobreak} (ending a paragraph if need be, to be sure you are indeed inhibiting a \em{frame} break).}
\item{\autodoc:command{\framebreak} and \autodoc:command{\eject} request a frame break.}
\item{\autodoc:command{\pagebreak} and \autodoc:command{\supereject} request a non-negotiable page break, and are more forceful variants of the previous commands, ensuring that a new page is opened even if there are remaining frames on the page.}
\end{itemize}

With \autodoc:command{\framebreak} and \autodoc:command{\pagebreak}, all vertical stretchable elements%
\footnote{Vertical: Here, in this document in latin script.
    The more advanced topic of writing directions and foreign scripts is tackled later in this manual.}
    are expanded to fill up the remaining space as much as possible.
The \autodoc:command{\eject} and \autodoc:command{\supereject} variants insert an infinite vertical stretch, so that all vertical stretchable elements on the page stay at their natural size.

\section{Including other files and code}

To make it easier for you to author a large document, you can break your SILE document up into multiple files.
For instance, you may wish to put each chapter into a separate file, or you may wish to develop a file of user-defined commands (see Chapter 6) and keep this separate from the main body of the document.
You will then need the ability to include one SILE file from another.

This ability is provided by the \autodoc:command{\include} command.
It takes one mandatory parameter, \autodoc:parameter{src=<path>}, which represents the path to the file.
So for instance, you may wish to write a thesis like this:

\begin[type=autodoc:codeblock]{raw}
\begin[class=thesis]{document}
\include[src=macros.xml]
\include[src=chap1.sil]
\include[src=chap2.sil]
\include[src=chap3.sil]
…
\include[src=endmatter.sil]
\end{document}
\end{raw}

\autodoc:command{\include}s may be nested: file A can include file B which includes file C.

The contents of an included file should be put in a \autodoc:environment{sile} environment (or a \code{<sile>} tag if the file is in XML flavour), like so:

\begin[type=autodoc:codeblock]{raw}
\begin{sile}

\chapter{A Scandal In Bohemia}

To Sherlock Holmes she is always \em{the woman}.

\end{sile}
\end{raw}

This is because every file is required to contain a valid XML tree, which wouldn’t be the case without a common root.

SILE is written in the Lua programming language, and the Lua interpreter is available at runtime.
Just as one can run Javascript code from within a HTML document using a \code{<script>} tag, one can run Lua code from within a SILE document using a \code{\\lua} command.
(A \code{\\script} command exists, but is being deprecated beginning in SILE v0.15.0.)

This command has three modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item{A Lua library may be loaded using the Lua package path, as in \code{\\lua[require=module.spec]}.}
\item{A Lua script may run by giving a filesystem path, as in \code{\\lua[src=path/to/file.lua]}.}
\item{Lua code can be provided as inline content, as in \code{\\lua\{SILE.typesetter:typeset("foo")\}}.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{autodoc:note}
  Another former use case or \code{\\script[src=…]} was to load SILE packages.
  This use case has been deprecated in favor of the more robust loader \code{\\use[module=…]}.
  Be sure to use a module spec with period delimiters not a path with slashes (e.g. \code{packages.math} not \code{packages/math}).
  This will ensure cross-platform compatibility as well as make sure packages don’t get loaded multiple times.
\end{autodoc:note}

Doing anything interesting inline requires knowledge of the internals of SILE, (thankfully the code is not that hard to read) but to get you started, the Lua function \code{SILE.typesetter:typeset(…)} will add text to a page, \code{SILE.call("…")} will call a SILE command, and \code{SILE.typesetter:leaveHmode()} ends the current paragraph and outputs the text.
For example:

\begin[type=autodoc:codeblock]{raw}
\begin{lua}
  for i=1,10 do
    SILE.typesetter:typeset(i .. " x " .. i .. " = " .. i*i .. ". ")
    SILE.typesetter:leaveHmode()
    SILE.call("smallskip")
  end
\end{lua}
\end{raw}

produces the following output:

\begin{autodoc:example}
\begin{lua}
  SILE.call("indent");SILE.typesetter:leaveHmode()
  for i=1,10 do
    SILE.typesetter:typeset(i .. " x " .. i .. " = " .. i*i .. ". ")
    SILE.typesetter:leaveHmode()
    SILE.call("smallskip")
  end
\end{lua}
\end{autodoc:example}

There is one notable caveat when embedding Lua code documents written with the TeX-flavor markup.
Since SILE has to first parse the TeX markup to find the start and end of such lua commands \em{without} understanding what’s in between, it is strictly necessary that no end tags appear inside the Lua code.
This means that for the environment block version (\code{\\begin\{lua\}}) there must be no instances of \code{\\end\{lua\}} inside the Lua code block, even inside a string that would otherwise be valid Lua code (e.g., if it was inside a quoted string or Lua comment).
The first instance of such an end tag terminates the block, and there is currently no way to escape it.
For the inline command form (\code{\\lua}) an exact matching number of open and closing braces may appear in the Lua code—the next closing brace at the same level as the opening brace will close the tag, even if it happens to be inside some quoted string in the Lua code.
Including any number of nested opening and closing braces is possible as long as they are balanced.

\section{Including raw inline content}

When parsing a SIL file, SILE invokes an “inputter” module, which implements the SIL language grammar and constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) for processing.
This implies that the content of any command or environment is in SIL syntax.

However, there are cases when you may need to pass raw content that should remain unparsed — or, more properly, later parsed by a \em{different} grammar.
While you could escape all special characters in your content with backslashes to prevent them from being interpreted as SIL constructs, this approach is tedious and cumbersome.

This issue already arises in several scenarios.
For instance, the \code{\\lua} command (and the legacy \code{\\script} command) described above fall into this category.
In these cases, one expects to use Lua code without the need for escaping it.

Similarly, the content of the \code{\\math} command (for the \autodoc:package{math} package) falls outside the scope of the SIL language syntax and requires a different grammar.
After all, its content follows the TeX math syntax, with commands with multiple arguments, special use of brackets, and so on.
Therefore, we need to instruct the SIL parser that this content should not be interpreted,but rather extracted as a raw string.
Later, it will be fed to another dedicated inputter for parsing.\footnote{In the case of math, it is currently a \em{pseudo}-inputter, but that is an implementation detail.}

The SIL inputter reserves a few special keywords: \code{\\lua}, \code{\\script}; but also \code{\\ftl}, \code{\\math}, \code{\\sil}, \code{\\use}, \code{\\xml}; and finally \code{\\raw}, which we will discuss here.

It is obvious that we can’t reserve too many keywords in advance.
However, they must be known \em{before} parsing a file, which means they can’t be dynamic.
The reserved keywords can’t be overridden or redefined after document parsing has begun.
So, how can we achieve extensibility?

SILE provides a mechanism to address this: \em{raw handlers}.
Through the Lua interface, packages and classes can register a function that gets called when a raw command is encountered in the input stream.
From within a SIL file, the \code{\\raw[type=…]} command can then be used to invoke that handler, passing the raw content.\footnote{In a certain sense, all things equal, raw handlers are similar to the concept of “CDATA sections” in XML.}

Raw handlers are identified by the \autodoc:parameter{type} parameter.
By default, SILE comes with a \code{text} raw handler, which simply typesets its content“verbatim” (as a string) without interpreting it.
Packages and classes can register their own additional raw handlers to fulfill specific needs.
